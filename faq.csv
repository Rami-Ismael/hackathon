They may have policies and procedures in place for such requests. You can contact them via phone, email or in-person to discuss your situation and request any necessary accommodation."
"My professor gives a pop quiz or short test during part of the class period. How does this work with my accommodations?
","Quizzes can be complicated to accommodate, especially if you do not know about them in advance. It’s important to work out the details early in the semester when you see on your syllabus that there will be quizzes in addition to regular exams. 

Many students decide not to use their accommodations on quizzes since they are typically short, and students would have to leave class to go to their eligible testing center. However, it is your choice, and if you do need to use your accommodations, they should be made available to you. 

If you decide you want to use your testing accommodations for quizzes and you know about them in advance, ask the professor if you can take the quiz earlier or later than the class period in a location they provide. If you are eligible to test at the ARC, then you may submit the appropriate test scheduling form. 

If you need a reader, scribe, digital text or any other accommodations that require significant lead time, it is extremely important to discuss these accommodations with the ARC and your professors as soon as possible for quizzes especially pop quizzes. 

The quizzes often are given after class starts; for example, if the class starts at 10 a.m., the test might begin at 10:30 a.m. If you are eligible to take the test at the ARC Testing Center, you are required to start all tests, exams or quizzes on the hour (e.g., 9 a.m., 10 a.m., etc.). In this situation, you will need to get clearance from the professor to take the quiz at any time the ARC Testing Center is open the same date the class takes the quiz or test. 

If you schedule the test earlier or later than the class with the ARC and the professor approves, you will need to begin the test promptly at the start time you reserved. In other words, you cannot schedule a test at 10 a.m. in the ARC then show up at 10:30 a.m. to take the quiz when the rest of the class starts. If you are more than 15 minutes late for your scheduled testing time, you will not be allowed to test. 

Some professors like to discuss the questions on the quiz during class when students are finished. If you arrange to take the quiz after the class due to an accommodation, you must leave the classroom when such discussions occur. 

Faculty are sometimes using quizzes to check attendance (possibly by using clickers). If this is the case, contact the ARC as early as possible so we can work with you and the instructor to identify accommodation options.",https://Accessibility.utdallas.edu/student-accommodations/frequently-asked-questions/,Student Accessibility,0,0,0,0.0,"You should talk to your professor about your accommodations and how they can be implemented during pop quizzes or short tests.

2. Schedule conflict: The student may have other commitments that clash with the test days.

3. Distance: The student may live far from school, and it may not be feasible for them to attend tests regularly.

4. Personal reasons: The student may have personal issues that prevent them from coming to school, such as family responsibilities or psychological difficulties.

5. School policy: The school may have a policy that requires students to attend classes regularly to take tests."
My class has attendance requirements because students are graded while I observe what they are doing and they must access specialized lab equipment that cannot be moved. How can I allow remote learning? ,"In rare cases, it can be a fundamental alteration of your class, which is not required even by accommodation. However, to make this decision it is essential that faculty consult with their department/program heads and the Accessibility Resource Center before denying an accommodation. 

",https://Accessibility.utdallas.edu/student-accommodations/frequently-asked-questions/,Student Accessibility,0,0,0,0.0,"Here are some possible solutions to allow remote learning:

1. Offer a hybrid model: You could offer a combination of in-person and remote learning. Students could attend some classes in person to access the specialized lab equipment, while other classes can be held online. This can help minimize the number of days students need to be on campus and make it easier for them to attend classes if they are not able to come to campus.

2. Record and share lab sessions: You could record lab sessions and share them with students online. This way, even if they can't be physically present in the lab, they can still access the content and learn from it.

3. Use virtual lab simulations: There are many virtual lab simulations available now that can provide students with a similar experience to working in a physical lab. You could incorporate these into your classes and use them as a way for students to complete labs from home.

4. Assign remote projects: You could assign remote projects that students can complete from home. This allows students to still engage with the material and complete work, even if they are not able to physically attend class.

5. Provide virtual office hours: You could offer virtual office hours where students can meet with you online to discuss class material, ask questions, or get help with assignments. This helps ensure that students still have access to you and can get the support they need to succeed in the class."
Online tests compromise my exam security. Why can’t these students take their exams on campus at the Accessibility Resource Center? ,The ARC testing facilities are now limited to students with accommodations requiring adaptive technology or other more specialized needs. The facilities are not large enough to provide social distancing for more than a minimal number of test takers.This semester we recommend that professors consider giving online exams for all students eligible to take a test with accommodations. Faculty still may use Honorlock or other remote proctoring services.,https://Accessibility.utdallas.edu/student-accommodations/frequently-asked-questions/,Student Accessibility,0,0,0,0.0,"As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can suggest that one reason online tests may be used is to provide flexibility for students who may not be able to physically come to campus, such as those who live far away or have other obligations. Additionally, the Accessibility Resource Center may not have the capacity to accommodate all students who require testing accommodations. It is important for educational institutions to balance exam security with accessibility for all students."
"How should I talk to my professor about class absences? 
","We recommend students talk to professors to help bridge the gap between a personal/family situation, illness or injury, or any other matters that may be impacting ability to temporarily attend classes, focus on classwork, and/or meet academic deadlines. 

To assist with communications, we recommend the following tips to students: 

Email professor to convey initial situation. 
Discreet language you can use: “medical reasons,” “unexpected personal situation,” “on-going health needs,” “family situation,” etc. 
Utilize professor’s office hours or ask to schedule an appointment to follow up about missed coursework. 
Share documentation that can verify dates and situations. 
Plan ahead to discuss missed work (quizzes, assignments, exams, class participation). 
Try to create an action plan with the professor after meeting/talking. 
Continue to follow up with professors for additional missed classes.

Missing Residential Student Policy:

The Residential Life Department’s first priority is to ensure the safety and security of all residents living on-campus. Unfortunately, there may be circumstances when a student is unable to be located or accounted for. This Missing Residential Student Policy is designed to outline the protocol for reporting a missing resident and to coordinate a thorough search effort to locate the individual as quickly as possible.

Definitions
1. A student will be considered missing when they have not been seen or heard from in a reasonable amount of time, and their whereabouts cannot be determined.
2. The designated emergency contact(s) identified for the missing resident are the individual(s) who will be contacted if the student is determined to be missing.
3. A missing person investigation will be initiated by the Residential Life Department, and the campus law enforcement agency will be notified immediately.

Reporting a Missing Residential Student
Anyone concerned about a residential student's whereabouts or well-being should notify Residential Life staff or the campus law enforcement agency immediately. The notification should be made as soon as possible.

Investigation
Once notified of a missing residential student, the Residential Life Department will launch an investigation. The investigation may include, but is not limited to, contacting relatives or friends, searching the last known locations, and reviewing video surveillance footage. The police will also be notified to participate in the investigation.

Search Procedures
In case of a confirmed missing residential student, the Residential Life Department will ask the campus community, staff, and students to assist with the search efforts. Any information or tips regarding the missing resident should be reported immediately to the Residential Life Department or the campus law enforcement agency. A systematic search will be conducted to cover all possible locations on campus, including nearby hospitals and other medical facilities.

Follow-Up Procedures
Once a missing residential student has been located, the campus law enforcement agency will notify the Residential Life Department, and the emergency contact(s) will be contacted.

Amending or Updating this Policy
The Residential Life Department is responsible for reviewing and updating this policy as it deems necessary.

This policy aims to establish procedures that can be followed in case of a missing residential student. It ensures that any such scenarios are handled appropriately and promptly to ensure the safe return of the student."

Its purpose is to provide additional protection to individuals who are at risk of being victims of sexual offenses on college campuses. The law requires colleges and universities to provide students with information about the prevalence of sexual offenses on their campus, as well as resources for reporting and responding to such incidents.

Under the CSCPA, colleges and universities are required to:

- Provide students with information about their campus’ policy concerning sexual offenses, including the penalties for such offenses.
- Provide victims of sexual offenses with the option to notify law enforcement authorities.
- Notify campus students and employees when a sexual offender has enrolled or is employed at the institution.
- Provide ongoing prevention and awareness programs for students and employees.
- Report crime statistics pertaining to sexual offenses that occur on their campus to the U.S. Department of Education.

In addition to these requirements, the CSCPA also established the Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Grants Program, which provides funding for colleges and universities to develop and implement programs to prevent and respond to sexual offenses on campus.

The CSCPA was enacted in response to the increasing awareness of the prevalence of sexual offenses on college campuses and the need for greater protection for students. The law has been instrumental in raising awareness of sexual offenses and improving the response of colleges and universities to these incidents."
